Reveal Question 4 Solution Guide This one requires a bit more steps and some trial &amp; error, as real OSI challenges often require you to. So, we know that this building is the Flatiron building, which is in New York City. NYC has a building records website that you can find by searching it up: https://a810-dobnow.nyc.gov/publish/Index.html#!. This website can search the Public Portal for a particular building with Address, Borough, Block, Lot, and BIN. We are looking for the BIN so we obviously can't search with that. So, you have 2 options left. The problem with the Address option is that we have no clue what the House Number field is supposed to be for this building. Some searching could help you figure it out but I found it easier to use the other option (Borough, Block, Lot). This option has 3 fields: Borough, Block, and an optional Lot. To find the Borough, you can search up &quot;what borough is flatiron building in&quot;. The Block is the tricky part to find that will require trial and error. I searched up &quot;flatiron building block number&quot; in Google and browsed the results. You could potentially click and check all the initial links but if you scroll a little bit, you will find a PDF doc from the nyc.gov website which seems like a really good source to check out. Reveal Borough and Block The Borough is Manhattan. The Block can be found on this pdf: https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0219.pdf. One of the initial lines contains not just the Block number but also the Lot (Block: 851, Lot: 1).

Please do that challenge and look over the solution guide before moving to this one. In RockYou, we used Hashcat to do a wordlist attack (aka Rainbow Tables Attack). However, we do not have a dictionary this time. We only have the password format of THP-PASS-#### where the 4 numbers are unknown. Therefore, we will have to do a different attack to bruteforce every single number combination possible. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will be using Hashcat again for this. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. I encourage you to take a look at hashcat's attack modes here (near the bottom of the page) and figure out which one to use. Reveal Attack Type We will need to bruteforce every single number combination for this attack. Therefore, the best attack method for this would be Mask Attack. This will let us put a mask of ?d in place of each number we don't know to tell hashcat to hash every single combination from THP-PASS-0000 to THP-PASS-9999 and compare to the target hash. The ID for this is attack type is 3. Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_mask] I encourage you to craft the command yourself by referencing the wiki for our attack type. Reveal Command hashcat -a 3 -m 0 a9fe58ebbe541f23dcb988ac47e7ee6f THP-PASS-?d?d?d?d After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password from THP-PASS-0000 to THP-PASS-9999 and compare with the target hash.

Target Hash: 1a3dff6f600d9fd62f8ead361480cc61  Check  ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Solution​","type":1,"pageTitle":"RockYou","url":"/practice/PasswordCracking/Easy/rockyou#solution","content":" Solution Guide Before we dive into the solution, let's quickly cover some background on password hashing. What is Hashing?​ Hashing is the process of turning data, like a password, into a fixed-length string using a mathematical function. It’s one-way, meaning it can't be reversed to reveal the original password. Each time the same password is hashed, it produces the same output. Why Do Websites Use Hashing?​ Websites don’t store your actual password for security reasons. Instead, they store the hashed version. When you log in, the site hashes the password you enter and compares it to the stored hash linked to your username/email. If they match, you're allowed in. This ensures that even if someone steals the database, they can't easily recover your password. Hash Cracking​ Even though hashes can't be reversed, attackers can still crack them by generating hashes from potential passwords and comparing them to the given hash. This is done by brute-forcing hashes from a list of potential passwords. The attacker hashes each password and compares it to the target hash. When a match is found, the original password is revealed. There are many methods to generate these potential passwords, including: Brute-force: Trying every possible combination of characters.Dictionary attacks: Using a predefined list of common passwords (like RockYou).Rainbow tables: Precomputed tables that speed up the hash comparison process. Now, let’s move on to cracking the password in this challenge! This challenge involves a popular list of leaked passwords from the RockYou breach. This list is preinstalled in Kali Linux (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz) but can also be downloaded here. tip You don't need to unzip rockyou.txt.gz. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will use a tool called Hashcat for this which is preinstalled in Kali Linux but can also be downloaded here. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. Since we already have a password list (rockyou.txt), we will use a Dictionary Attack. The ID for this is attack type is 0. info You can learn more about hashcat's attack modes here (scroll to the bottom). Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_dictionary] I encourage you to craft the command yourself. Reveal Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1a3dff6f600d9fd62f8ead361480cc61 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password in the dictionary and comparing with our hash. This may take a few minutes but after a while, we should see our hash cracked!

This file is a .pyc file, which is a Python Compiled bytecode file. Since this is compiled, we cannot read the source code just by opening it. Try runnning the program and see what happens. We will be using a Linux terminal for this tutorial. warning If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to specify python3 instead of python. $ python rev.pyc After executing this, you will see that the program is asking for a password. If we try to guess a random password, we get a message of Access Denied. It seems we will have to dig further with this file. Fortunately, there are local and online PYC decompilers. One great online tool is PyLingual. After decompiling the PYC file, we can see the entire source code of the program. Reveal Source Code def caesar_shift_encrypt(text, shift): encrypted_text = '' for char in text: if char.isalpha(): shifted_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a')) encrypted_text += shifted_char else: encrypted_text += char return encrypted_text def check_password(input_password): encrypted_password = 'yfwmjfpb' shift = 9 encrypted_input = caesar_shift_encrypt(input_password, shift) if encrypted_input == encrypted_password: return 'Access Granted' return 'Access Denied' input_password = input('Enter the password: ') result = check_password(input_password) print(result) Upon inspecting this python code, we can see that the script is using Caesar Cipher with a shift of 9 to encrypt the password and compare it against the ciphertext yfwmjfpb. We can easily reverse this with a website like https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher and retrieve the password!
