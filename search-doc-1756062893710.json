A quick Google search will give the company's nameThe car's license plate tells us we are probably in Georgia. There is also a street sign visible. Simply look up the street name along with the state on Google or Google Maps to find the city's name.This one is a bit trickier. You will have to use an image metadata analyzer (aka Image Exif Viewer) to find the answer. There are plenty online and almost any will work. Simply upload the picture and scroll through the shown metadata until you find the company's name. Cryptography​ Use a cipher identifier tool to figure out what method is being used, like DCode's Cipher Identifier. From there, it's trial and error with the different cipher tools shown. Reveal Cipher It is a simple Caesar Cipher (aka Shift Cipher) with a shift of 6. Again, use a cipher identifier tool like DCode's Cipher Identifier. It will tell you that the cipher is Morse Code. Simply go to the Morse Code tool and decode. Web App Exploitation​ Right click the hint image for Flag 1 and click Inspect Element. The image's alt text is the flag.The hint image shows the Cookie Monster, referencing the website's Cookies. These can be viewed by (assuming MS Edge or Google Chrome): Inspect Element the page anywhere (or enter Developer Tools with F12)At the top of the Developer Tools window, navigate to the Application window. You may have to click the + to find it.Expand the dropdown for Cookies and click the only item underneath. This will show you a cookie called flag_2 with a value of VEhQe2Nvb2tpZV9tb25zdGVyfQ==. This is the flag but it's encoded. You will need to decode this which can be done using a cipher identifier tool like DCode's Cipher Identifier. It will tell you that it is Base64. Click the given tool and decode it to find the flag! tip To make decoding Base64 easier in the future, look out for = signs at the end of the cipher. If there is one or two = sign present at the end, it is most likely encoded in Base64.

The best way to see what's wrong with a corrupted file is by comparing it with another similar file. Let's open any non-corrupted PNG image in Hexedit (here's an image you can use). Upon comparing the two files, you should immediately see a difference at the very beginning of the file. Here's what it looks like for each image: Corrupted ImageSample Image The sample image beings with 89 50 4E 47 (utf-8: ëPNG) whereas the corrupted image is missing it! This is the PNG file header. It is essential for an image rendering software to identify the image type and render it. Our corrupted image is missing this header, so let's add it. We can do this in Hexedit by Right Clicking the first hex byte &gt; Insert Bytes Here &gt; 4 Bytes. Then, we manually type the header stated above.

What is Hashing? Hashing is the process of converting/encrypting data, like a password, into a fixed-length string using a mathematical function. It’s one-way, meaning it can't be reversed to reveal the original password. Each time the same password is hashed, it always produces the same output. Why Do We Use Hashing? Websites don’t store your actual password for security reasons. Instead, they store the hashed version. When you log in, the site hashes the password you enter and compares it to the stored hash linked to your username/email. If they match, you're allowed in. This ensures that even if someone steals the password database, they can't easily recover your password. Hash Cracking Even though hashes can't be reversed, attackers can still crack them by generating hashes from potential passwords and comparing them to the given hash. This is done by brute-forcing hashes from a list of potential passwords. The attacker hashes each password and compares it to the target hash. When a match is found, the original password is revealed. There are many methods to generate these potential passwords, including but not limited to: Brute-force: Trying every possible combination of characters.Dictionary attacks: Using a predefined list of common passwords (like RockYou).Mask Attacks: Bruteforcing only part of the passwordHybrid Attacks: Combination of attack techniquesRainbow tables: Precomputed tables that speed up the hash comparison process. Now, let’s move on to cracking the password in this challenge! This challenge involves a popular list of leaked passwords from the RockYou breach. This list is preinstalled in Kali Linux (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz) but can also be downloaded here. tip You don't need to unzip rockyou.txt.gz. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will use a tool called Hashcat for this which is preinstalled in Kali Linux but can also be downloaded here. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. Since we already have a password list (rockyou.txt), we will use a Dictionary Attack. The ID for this is attack type is 0. info You can learn more about hashcat's attack modes here (scroll to the bottom). Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_dictionary] I encourage you to craft the command yourself. Reveal Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1a3dff6f600d9fd62f8ead361480cc61 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz tip Append your hashcat commands with -O to use Optimized Kernel. This speeds up the cracking process by limiting the password length to 12 characters. After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password in the dictionary and comparing with our hash. This may take a few minutes but after a while, we should see our hash cracked!

After mastering Excel, it is recomended to learn DAAS tools like Splunk, Datadog, or Solarwinds to further refine your log analysis skills to become a master in this hacking form. The .log file is seperated into 4 columns: Time, Ticker, Frequency, and Amplitude. Now, we need to find a way to copy and paste each column as it's own column in excel. However, when I try to copy and paste the log file into excel, it puts all the data in one column, which is not what we want. Thus, we rely on good ol' reliable python to extract each individual column of the dataframe. I have provided the python file to help you with extraction in the HINT. Now if there was a way to copy and paste each individual column from the log file to their own respective column in the excel sheet without python, then be my guest. However, in this case, we are using the help of python to seamlessly copy over the data so that the excel sheet can mirror the log file. Although the python file extracts all the columns, we really only need to copy over 'time', 'amplitude' columns, and maybe the 'Ticker' column as well. Once you copied over the numbers and their headers to excel, select ONLY the ‘frequency’ and ‘amplitude’ columns. After selecting the two columns, search for ‘XY scatter’ and select the first scatter plot option. You should see an outlier in the data among the 'Y' axis. There is only one ticker that goes beyond the [-1.00, 1.00] Hertz frequency bound, and that ticker is the flag! P.S. This is the actual frequency data extracted from a snippit of a ichika-nito solo.

Some searching could help you figure it out but I found it easier to use the other option (Borough, Block, Lot). This option has 3 fields: Borough, Block, and an optional Lot. To find the Borough, you can search up &quot;what borough is flatiron building in&quot;. The Block is the tricky part to find that will require trial and error.

Reveal Borough and Block The Borough is Manhattan. The Block can be found on this pdf: https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0219.pdf. One of the initial lines contains not just the Block number but also the Lot (Block: 851, Lot: 1). After you have these fields, you can now search the database with it, double click the only result, and it should give you the Flatiron Building with the BIN!

Hashcat Rules Welcome to the world of hashcat rules! Before we get started, let me explain what rules are in hashcat and how they work. Hashcat rules are used to manipulate and transform wordlists during password-cracking attempts. They apply specific modifications (such as capitalization, reversing, appending numbers, or replacing characters) to existing dictionary words, effectively expanding your dictionary to cover variations of passwords without needing enormous lists. As such, they can only work with dictionary attacks (-a 0). How Do Hashcat Rules Work? Hashcat rules are simple yet powerful instructions that tell hashcat how to modify words from a wordlist. Each rule can consist of multiple commands, executed sequentially. Common hashcat rule operations include: l - Lowercase all lettersu - Uppercase all lettersc - Capitalize the first letterr - Reverse the word$X - Append character 'X' at the end^X - Prepend character 'X' at the beginningsXY - Replace all instances of 'X' with 'Y' These simple commands can be chained together to form more complex rules. Here's how you'd typically structure a hashcat command using rules: hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt -r rules.rule If you want to learn more in depth, try Rulemaker after finishing this challenge. Alright, now let's solve this challenge. You should be able to find a wordlist with knowledge from Fusion. warning When using wordlists with rules, you should always remove all spaces &amp; special characters and convert the wordlist to lowercase beforehand Now, we know we'll have to use a rule in hashcat. Generally, your approach should start with premade rules that are preinstalled with Hashcat. In Kali Linux, you can find them under /usr/share/hashcat/rules/. If you explore and try some of the rule files there, you will eventually crack the hash. The challenge name is a hint to which one! Go ahead and craft your command. Reveal Final Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt vehicles.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/dive.rule You should now have cracked the password!

As you may be able to tell from the challenge title, we need to fuse or combine 2 different password cracking techniques for this: dictionary attack &amp; mask attack. But notice, we are not provided with a wordlist so we will need to research. Obtain Wordlist My #1 source for finding wordlists and datasets is either GitHub or Kaggle. This challenge uses one from Kaggle although I'm sure it can be solved with other wordlists. We know it's a Netflix show/movie so why not look for the most popular one on Kaggle. Reveal Wordlist https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows Download the wordlist, open with Excel, and copy the Title column to a text document. Name it something like netflix.txt Crack the password We're now ready to attack the hash and obtain our password. As usual, we will use hashcat but this time with their Hybrid mode. Hashcat has two hybrid modes. Attack mode -a 6 is wordlist appended with mask (wordlist + mask). Attack mode -a 7 is wordlist prepended with mask (mask + wordlist). We know our hash is our wordlist with a number (the mask) appended at the end so we will use -a 6. You should know how to find out hash type from RockYou. You should know which mask to use from Masked. I now encourage you to craft the attack command yourself.

You should know how to get the wordlist for animals (make sure to sanitize it, remove spaces, &amp; make it lowercase). You'll notice that if you try any pre existing rules in hashcat, you won't get the password. This is because this challenge requires you to craft your own rules. How to make rules in Hashcat As you know from Diver, Hashcat rules let you transform every word in your wordlist using lightweight text manipulation instructions. It’s like regex, but much more optimized and tuned specifically for password cracking. Rules are written one instruction per line, with each instruction telling Hashcat how to modify the base word. You can do things like: Add characters ($! adds ! to the end, ^@ adds @ to the beginning)Change case (u = uppercase all, l = lowercase all, c = capitalize)Substitute characters (saz changes a to z)Insert/delete characters at specific positionsCombine multiple operations in one line There's 2 types or rules: mutators (modify/replace characters) &amp; additives (add/remove characters) Here’s a quick cheat sheet &amp; guide: https://kaoticcreations.blogspot.com/2011/09/explanation-of-hashcat-rules.html You can combine rules like this: ^@ c $1. That will take a word like tiger and turn it into @Tiger1. Once you have all the rules writted down in a text file, you can save it as &lt;name&gt;.rule. To use a rule, just append your traditional dictionary attack command with -r yourRule.rule. Rule stacking You can stack &amp; combine multiple rule files (can be same or different). So let's say you have a rule file named my.rule, you can stack and make it apply twice by executing: hashcat -a 0 -m &lt;mode&gt; hash.txt wordlist.txt -r my.rule -r my.rule This helps you make smaller rule files with the function of bigger ones. Alright, now let's apply this new knowledge we've learned and make our own rule file! We know that we want to prepend and append special characters and numbers. Recall that prepending is done with ^ and appending is done with $. So, let's make our rule file (you can do it manually or write a script to automate it)! Reveal rule file $~ $` $! $@ $# $$ $% $^ $&amp; $* $( $) $- $_ $+ $= ${ $} $[ $] $| $\\ $; $: $&quot; $&lt; $&gt; $, $. $/ $? $0 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 $7 $8 $9 ^` ^! ^@ ^# ^$ ^% ^^ ^&amp; ^* ^( ^) ^- ^_ ^+ ^= ^{ ^} ^[ ^] ^| ^\\ ^; ^: ^&quot; ^&lt; ^&gt; ^, ^. ^/ ^? ^0 ^1 ^2 ^3 ^4 ^5 ^6 ^7 ^8 ^9 Let's name it something like additive1.rule and try it out! hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt animals.txt -r additive1.rule tip Appending -S to your hashcat commands helps improve performance when you're using bigger rule files (this challenge won't use a big one) ...and you notice it gives you nothing. Well maybe this is because the rule is only prepending or appending one character, our password could potentially have more. So, let's try rule stacking! Apply this rule twice or more times if needed! Reveal Final Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt animals.txt -r additive1.rule -r additive1.rule -r additive1.rule You should now have cracked the password!
