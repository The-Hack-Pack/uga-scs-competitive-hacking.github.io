## Contribution Guide

**This is our guide on how you can make your own challenges or edit existing ones for this website!**
<br>

Our GitHub repository is available [**here**](https://github.com/The-Hack-Pack/uga-scs-competitive-hacking.github.io). We use a static-site generator called [**Docusaurus**](https://docusaurus.io/) version 3.7.0, which you should familiarize yourself with first. After you have a basic understanding of the documentation, you can proceed to either make your own challenge or edit an existing one!

2. Head to the `docs` folder from root and you will see folders for all the categories
