Simply look up the street name along with the state on Google or Google Maps to find the city's name.This one is a bit trickier. You will have to use an image metadata analyzer (aka Image Exif Viewer) to find the answer. There are plenty online and almost any will work. Simply upload the picture and scroll through the shown metadata until you find the company's name.

Reveal Cipher It is a simple Caesar Cipher (aka Shift Cipher) with a shift of 6. Again, use a cipher identifier tool like DCode's Cipher Identifier. It will tell you that the cipher is Morse Code.

Hashcat Rules Welcome to the world of hashcat rules! Before we get started, let me explain what rules are in hashcat and how they work. Hashcat rules are used to manipulate and transform wordlists during password-cracking attempts. They apply specific modifications (such as capitalization, reversing, appending numbers, or replacing characters) to existing dictionary words, effectively expanding your dictionary to cover variations of passwords without needing enormous lists. As such, they can only work with dictionary attacks (-a 0). How Do Hashcat Rules Work? Hashcat rules are simple yet powerful instructions that tell hashcat how to modify words from a wordlist. Each rule can consist of multiple commands, executed sequentially. Common hashcat rule operations include: l - Lowercase all lettersu - Uppercase all lettersc - Capitalize the first letterr - Reverse the word$X - Append character 'X' at the end^X - Prepend character 'X' at the beginningsXY - Replace all instances of 'X' with 'Y' These simple commands can be chained together to form more complex rules. Here's how you'd typically structure a hashcat command using rules: hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt -r rules.rule If you want to learn more in depth, try Rulemaker after finishing this challenge. Alright, now let's solve this challenge. You should be able to find a wordlist with knowledge from Fusion. warning When using wordlists with rules, you should always remove all spaces &amp; special characters and convert the wordlist to lowercase beforehand Now, we know we'll have to use a rule in hashcat. Generally, your approach should start with premade rules that are preinstalled with Hashcat. In Kali Linux, you can find them under /usr/share/hashcat/rules/. If you explore and try some of the rule files there, you will eventually crack the hash. The challenge name is a hint to which one! Go ahead and craft your command. Reveal Final Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 hash.txt vehicles.txt -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/dive.rule You should now have cracked the password!

Thus, Math Rock attempts to be an introduction to using Excel in order to solve log analysis challenges. After mastering Excel, it is recomended to learn DAAS tools like Splunk, Datadog, or Solarwinds to further refine your log analysis skills to become a master in this hacking form. The .log file is seperated into 4 columns: Time, Ticker, Frequency, and Amplitude. Now, we need to find a way to copy and paste each column as it's own column in excel. However, when I try to copy and paste the log file into excel, it puts all the data in one column, which is not what we want. Thus, we rely on good ol' reliable python to extract each individual column of the dataframe. I have provided the python file to help you with extraction in the HINT. Now if there was a way to copy and paste each individual column from the log file to their own respective column in the excel sheet without python, then be my guest. However, in this case, we are using the help of python to seamlessly copy over the data so that the excel sheet can mirror the log file. Although the python file extracts all the columns, we really only need to copy over 'time', 'amplitude' columns, and maybe the 'Ticker' column as well. Once you copied over the numbers and their headers to excel, select ONLY the ‘frequency’ and ‘amplitude’ columns. After selecting the two columns, search for ‘XY scatter’ and select the first scatter plot option. You should see an outlier in the data among the 'Y' axis. There is only one ticker that goes beyond the [-1.00, 1.00] Hertz frequency bound, and that ticker is the flag! P.S. This is the actual frequency data extracted from a snippit of a ichika-nito solo.

What is Hashing? Hashing is the process of converting/encrypting data, like a password, into a fixed-length string using a mathematical function. It’s one-way, meaning it can't be reversed to reveal the original password. Each time the same password is hashed, it always produces the same output. Why Do We Use Hashing? Websites don’t store your actual password for security reasons. Instead, they store the hashed version. When you log in, the site hashes the password you enter and compares it to the stored hash linked to your username/email. If they match, you're allowed in. This ensures that even if someone steals the password database, they can't easily recover your password. Hash Cracking Even though hashes can't be reversed, attackers can still crack them by generating hashes from potential passwords and comparing them to the given hash. This is done by brute-forcing hashes from a list of potential passwords. The attacker hashes each password and compares it to the target hash. When a match is found, the original password is revealed. There are many methods to generate these potential passwords, including but not limited to: Brute-force: Trying every possible combination of characters.Dictionary attacks: Using a predefined list of common passwords (like RockYou).Mask Attacks: Bruteforcing only part of the passwordHybrid Attacks: Combination of attack techniquesRainbow tables: Precomputed tables that speed up the hash comparison process. Now, let’s move on to cracking the password in this challenge! This challenge involves a popular list of leaked passwords from the RockYou breach. This list is preinstalled in Kali Linux (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz) but can also be downloaded here. tip You don't need to unzip rockyou.txt.gz. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will use a tool called Hashcat for this which is preinstalled in Kali Linux but can also be downloaded here. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. Since we already have a password list (rockyou.txt), we will use a Dictionary Attack. The ID for this is attack type is 0. info You can learn more about hashcat's attack modes here (scroll to the bottom). Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_dictionary] I encourage you to craft the command yourself. Reveal Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1a3dff6f600d9fd62f8ead361480cc61 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz tip Append your hashcat commands with -O to use Optimized Kernel. This speeds up the cracking process by limiting the password length to 12 characters. After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password in the dictionary and comparing with our hash. This may take a few minutes but after a while, we should see our hash cracked!

It assumes you have the answers to the previous questions so proceed when you've solved those. Reveal Question 4 Solution Guide This one requires a bit more steps and some trial &amp; error, as real OSI challenges often require you to. So, we know that this building is the Flatiron building, which is in New York City. NYC has a building records website that you can find by searching it up: https://a810-dobnow.nyc.gov/publish/Index.html#!. This website can search the Public Portal for a particular building with Address, Borough, Block, Lot, and BIN. We are looking for the BIN so we obviously can't search with that. So, you have 2 options left. The problem with the Address option is that we have no clue what the House Number field is supposed to be for this building. Some searching could help you figure it out but I found it easier to use the other option (Borough, Block, Lot). This option has 3 fields: Borough, Block, and an optional Lot. To find the Borough, you can search up &quot;what borough is flatiron building in&quot;. The Block is the tricky part to find that will require trial and error. I searched up &quot;flatiron building block number&quot; in Google and browsed the results. You could potentially click and check all the initial links but if you scroll a little bit, you will find a PDF doc from the nyc.gov website which seems like a really good source to check out. Reveal Borough and Block The Borough is Manhattan. The Block can be found on this pdf: https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/0219.pdf. One of the initial lines contains not just the Block number but also the Lot (Block: 851, Lot: 1).

You'll notice that if you try any pre existing rules in hashcat, you won't get the password. This is because this challenge requires you to craft your own rules. How to make rules in Hashcat As you know from Diver, Hashcat rules let you transform every word in your wordlist using lightweight text manipulation instructions. It’s like regex, but much more optimized and tuned specifically for password cracking. Rules are written one instruction per line, with each instruction telling Hashcat how to modify the base word. You can do things like: Add characters ($! adds ! to the end, ^@ adds @ to the beginning)Change case (u = uppercase all, l = lowercase all, c = capitalize)Substitute characters (saz changes a to z)Insert/delete characters at specific positionsCombine multiple operations in one line There's 2 types or rules: mutators (modify/replace characters) &amp; additives (add/remove characters) Here’s a quick cheat sheet &amp; guide: https://kaoticcreations.blogspot.com/2011/09/explanation-of-hashcat-rules.html You can combine rules like this: ^@ c $1. That will take a word like tiger and turn it into @Tiger1. Once you have all the rules writted down in a text file, you can save it as &lt;name&gt;.rule. To use a rule, just append your traditional dictionary attack command with -r yourRule.rule. Rule stacking You can stack &amp; combine multiple rule files (can be same or different). So let's say you have a rule file named my.rule, you can stack and make it apply twice by executing: hashcat -a 0 -m &lt;mode&gt; hash.txt wordlist.txt -r my.rule -r my.rule This helps you make smaller rule files with the function of bigger ones. Alright, now let's apply this new knowledge we've learned and make our own rule file! We know that we want to prepend and append special characters and numbers.

Please do that challenge and look over the solution guide before moving to this one. In RockYou, we used Hashcat to do a dictionary attack. However, we do not have a dictionary this time. We only have the password format of THP-PASS-#### where the 4 numbers are unknown. Therefore, we will have to do a different attack to bruteforce every single number combination possible. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will be using Hashcat again for this. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. I encourage you to take a look at hashcat's attack modes here (near the bottom of the page) and figure out which one to use. Reveal Attack Type We will need to bruteforce every single number combination for this attack. Therefore, the best attack method for this would be Mask Attack. This will let us put a mask of ?d in place of each number we don't know to tell hashcat to hash every single combination from THP-PASS-0000 to THP-PASS-9999 and compare to the target hash. The ID for this is attack type is 3. Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_mask] I encourage you to craft the command yourself by referencing the wiki for our attack type. Reveal Command hashcat -a 3 -m 0 a9fe58ebbe541f23dcb988ac47e7ee6f THP-PASS-?d?d?d?d After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password from THP-PASS-0000 to THP-PASS-9999 and compare with the target hash. This may take a few minutes depending on your computer but after a short while, we should see our hash cracked!
