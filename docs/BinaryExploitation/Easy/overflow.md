Binary Exploitation | Easy - Overflow
## Challenge
We've got a vulnerable binary. Can you crack it and retrive the flag?

NOTE: These challenges are hosted on a server with a flag.txt not given to you. We're too broke for a server right now so we're giving you the flag.txt file to solve locally.


Download binary: [hello](./assets/hello)

Download flag file: <a href="/assets/binExp/flag.txt" download>flag.txt</a>

<PasswordForm hash="bc965b3cf5e6d7e6000a02469ecc878aa0f88863f2617652c144e94102900963d4d1b9557b41f71dff160c82e25dd83693c2ae3bf12c569c7d26fc653f3c6bf9" algorithm="sha512" />
