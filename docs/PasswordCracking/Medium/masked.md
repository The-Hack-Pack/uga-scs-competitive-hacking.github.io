# Masked
Password Cracking | Medium - Masked
## Challenge
A password hash was retrieved that needs to be cracked. We have received intel that the password is of the format 

`THP-PASS-####`

where `#` is a number 0-9.

Target Hash: `a9fe58ebbe541f23dcb988ac47e7ee6f`

<PasswordForm hash="0b0583b4d6ee8fe50f52b780d92d4e774c371c8d42ef73beb2dbb284f6891388acf60ea4b201ad8f8704ae3e64e07bc33e0161f922d4e475bf73f61d5522141f" algorithm="sha512" />

## Solution
<details>
  <summary>Solution Guide</summary>
  
  This challenge assumes you have solved the Easy challenge [**RockYou**](https://thehackpack.org/practice/PasswordCracking/Easy/rockyou) and have a basic understanding of Hashcat. Please do that challenge and look over the solution guide before moving to this one. In RockYou, we used Hashcat to do a dictionary attack. However, we do not have a dictionary this time. We only have the password format of `THP-PASS-####` where the 4 numbers are unknown. Therefore, we will have to do a different attack to bruteforce every single number combination possible.

  Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an **MD5** hash.

  Our next step is to crack the hash. We will be using **Hashcat** again for this. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux.

  Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that [**here**](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes). Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is `0`. 

  Our next step is to choose an attack type. I encourage you to take a look at hashcat's attack modes [**here**](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=hashcat) (near the bottom of the page) and figure out which one to use.

    We will need to bruteforce every single number combination for this attack. Therefore, the best attack method for this would be [Mask Attack](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=mask_attack). This will let us put a `mask` of `?d` in place of each number we don't know to tell hashcat to hash every single combination from `THP-PASS-0000` to `THP-PASS-9999` and compare to the target hash.
    
    The ID for this is attack type is `3`.
  </details>

  Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is:
  ```bash
  hashcat -a <attack-mode> -m <hash-mode> [hash] [other_options_like_mask]
  ```
  I encourage you to craft the command yourself by referencing the wiki for our attack type.

      ```bash
      hashcat -a 3 -m 0 a9fe58ebbe541f23dcb988ac47e7ee6f THP-PASS-?d?d?d?d
      ```
  </details>

  After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password from `THP-PASS-0000` to `THP-PASS-9999` and compare with the target hash. This may take a few minutes depending on your computer but after a short while, we should see our hash cracked!
