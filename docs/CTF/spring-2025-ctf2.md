What city is this picture taken in? (1 word) <PasswordForm hash="94a53d9d451e60333db1e77ae15e4ac77c0dd6c57c744c0a0dd146669015c4349fc0e0c5ac7741696f32a285b6cbbc30c30972649ba09467472af868e1e87007" algorithm="sha512" />

What is the name of the Italian restaurant connected to that same building? (1 word) <PasswordForm hash="f6381713d0545790844d16f507db0e12537013e7571c17538b32d7c49a75aaea7d068dcd713968b3c9f03fea7ded235362d202f7a3a971faf9c58eee797879b6" algorithm="sha512" />

### Cryptography
We've intercepted 2 messages from hacker communications but they are encrypted, decode the messages.

Cipher 1: `01000100 01100101 01110000 01101100 01101111 01111001 01101001 01101110 01100111 00100000 01010011 01101011 01111001 01101110 01100101 01110100`<PasswordForm hash="a8b7fcee0be28efd1800989f72cf4366f7f8d1ae74c330fcbd28495afcc5b55854a93b4a567dcd8cc40958d8a6452fc00730c66a64ae6e0e19216cf8de6569ff" algorithm="sha512" />

Cipher 2: `ᒬᒧᒪ⨃ᒧᒣ☐ ⟔☐ᒪ☐ᒥᐱ☐⊐`<PasswordForm hash="e9e3df9e92bb4aa07765b862d21ba446e4c479bffb815e0954bc0dea42abedc3f32e09903dd65d263d8b6e6520d9c52ef2c9c3f1bb4819d0f58e1597960738d5" algorithm="sha512" />

### Web App Exploitation
We've identified a website hiding suspicious information. 

Access the challenge website <a href="https://thehackpack.org/CTF/webChallenge2/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Flag 1: <PasswordForm hash="c0bc4d987e272e316c795223d725a28092c957ffd14c28de8c6a6dea7e4aa992c0dd27c0b1f5243e23e6125189b1e8072c01a3d0eb3302e5165453c63d79c8a5" algorithm="sha512" />
Flag 2: <PasswordForm hash="a125f3f49045b31d03a9689922d56356d79629f2027e5b945f1956ee860fe2185db513821ac6524c69670a0468c3b6d820a77c6f7adc876ad1037dcbefb388ef" algorithm="sha512" />

### Log Analysis
We have received a set of system logs containing various user activities. Your task is to identify the suspicious login attempt and retrieve the username associated with that entry.

Username: <PasswordForm hash="1ea2732c1a0bc20979eccda090e893eaaafc8aeca786eb754ede092e69886c14556dd9f81ea7e57c0737b50b38edab0ee2152615174bc0c6c526f89c6cf39195" algorithm="sha512" />

### Forensics
We have received pictures of suspects involved in a cyberincident. We have come to the knowledge that the criminal submitted a picture of a fake person. Figure out which suspect is the criminal.

**NOTE: PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT THESE PEOPLE, THEY ARE REAL PEOPLE!**
