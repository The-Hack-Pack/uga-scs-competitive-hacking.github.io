    1. Title is related to the cipher being used
    2. Lyrics is the book/dictionary for the cipher
    3. To find the cipher, run strings on the mp3 file OR just open the file as a text file
       1. Cipher: 159, 150, 147, 40, 150, 221, 285, 147, 281, 242
    4. Copy paste Cipher and Lyrics (the “book”) into a decoder
    5. <b>scs\{BADHAIRDAY\}</b>
