## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Hack Pack web development team and community take all security vulnerabilities
seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open source
software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the Hack Pack team at:

```
hello@thehackpack.org
```

The organization will attempt to acknowledge your email within 24 hours, and will
send a more detailed response within 48 hours indicating the next steps in
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the Hack Pack
web developers will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and
full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or
team maintaining the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When the Hack Pack officers receive a security bug report, they will assign it
to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release
process, involving the following steps:

1. Confirm the problem.
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
3. repare fixes and release them as fast as possible.
