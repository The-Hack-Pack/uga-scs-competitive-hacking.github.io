## Challenge

My cousin is going on an excursion to a historical artists’ birth city. He sent me coordinates of the place. I can't seem to figure out where this location is. Can you help me out? (Please wrap all solutions within a ‘scs{}’ wrapper)

<b><i>45S 656837.40 3792031.36</i></b>

:::tip
<b> Think of the coordinate systems we went over in our presentation.</b>
