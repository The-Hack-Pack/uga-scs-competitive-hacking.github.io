This list is preinstalled in Kali Linux (/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz) but can also be downloaded here. tip You don't need to unzip rockyou.txt.gz. Our first step is to identify the hash type. This can be done with an online tool such as https://hashes.com/en/tools/hash_identifier. After submitting the hash here, we can see that it is identified as an MD5 hash. Our next step is to crack the hash. We will use a tool called Hashcat for this which is preinstalled in Kali Linux but can also be downloaded here. For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Kali Linux. Hashcat supports many hash modes, denoted by a numerical ID. We know our hash is MD5 so we just need to find the hash mode ID for it. We can find that here. Upon searching for MD5 here (it's the first one), we can see the hash mode is 0. Our next step is to choose an attack type. Since we already have a password list (rockyou.txt), we will use a Dictionary Attack. The ID for this is attack type is 0. info You can learn more about hashcat's attack modes here (scroll to the bottom). Now we can craft our command to crack the password. The format of a hashcat attack is: hashcat -a &lt;attack-mode&gt; -m &lt;hash-mode&gt; [hash] [other_options_like_dictionary] I encourage you to craft the command yourself. Reveal Command hashcat -a 0 -m 0 1a3dff6f600d9fd62f8ead361480cc61 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt.gz After executing this command, hashcat will start cracking the hash by hashing every single password in the dictionary and comparing with our hash. This may take a few minutes but after a while, we should see our hash cracked!

This file is a .pyc file, which is a Python Compiled bytecode file. Since this is compiled, we cannot read the source code just by opening it. Try runnning the program and see what happens. We will be using a Linux terminal for this tutorial. warning If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you may need to specify python3 instead of python. $ python rev.pyc After executing this, you will see that the program is asking for a password. If we try to guess a random password, we get a message of Access Denied. It seems we will have to dig further with this file. Fortunately, there are local and online PYC decompilers. One great online tool is PyLingual. After decompiling the PYC file, we can see the entire source code of the program. Reveal Source Code def caesar_shift_encrypt(text, shift): encrypted_text = '' for char in text: if char.isalpha(): shifted_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a')) encrypted_text += shifted_char else: encrypted_text += char return encrypted_text def check_password(input_password): encrypted_password = 'yfwmjfpb' shift = 9 encrypted_input = caesar_shift_encrypt(input_password, shift) if encrypted_input == encrypted_password: return 'Access Granted' return 'Access Denied' input_password = input('Enter the password: ') result = check_password(input_password) print(result) Upon inspecting this python code, we can see that the script is using Caesar Cipher with a shift of 9 to encrypt the password and compare it against the ciphertext yfwmjfpb. We can easily reverse this with a website like https://www.dcode.fr/caesar-cipher and retrieve the password! ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"}],"options":{"id":"default"}}
